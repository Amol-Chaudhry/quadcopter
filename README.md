# Quadcopter

Our objective for this project was to design and build a quadcopter that was capable of stable flight with manual radio control. More specifically, our goal was to implement an Arduino microcontroller as the quadcopter flight controller, and program this Arduino with our own custom code. While there are many open-source programs that enable Arduino boards to be used as flight controllers, we wanted to develop the code ourselves in order to learn more about what makes quadcopter flight possible.
